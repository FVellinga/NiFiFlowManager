# NiFiFlowManager
NiFi Flow Manager. An extracting tool to merge single flows into one merged flow

<p>This is a Windows Forms application and only runs on Windows machines</p>

<p>Description here is under development, draft.</br>
The pdf explains the purpose of this application.</br>
The application itself needs some more work. It runs but no installation instructions yet.</br>
But when you put NiFiFlow.exe.config and NiFiFlow.exe in a directory of your choice, it should run.<p> 
<p>Anyway, working on it.</p>
