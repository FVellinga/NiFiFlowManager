# NiFi Flow Manager
An extracting tool to merge single flows into one merged flow

<p>It is Windows application</p>

<p>The description here is under development. The pdf explains the purpose of this application.</br>
The application itself needs some more work. It runs but no installation instructions yet.</br>
But when you put NiFiFlow.exe.config and NiFiFlow.exe in a directory of your choice, it should run.<p> 
<p>Anyway, working on it.</p>
